<h4>Yield: 16 servings</h4>

<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
  <li>1 1/2 cups Semi-sweet chocolate chips</li>
  <li>12 tbps Unsalted butter, chopped</li>
  <li>1/3 cup Unsweeted cocoa powder</li>
  <li>1 tsp Espresso powder</li>
  <li>1/4 tsp Cinnamon</li>
  <li>3 Eggs</li>
  <li>1 1/2 cups Sugar</li>
  <li>2 tbsp Brown Sugar</li>
  <li>1 1/2 tsp Vanilla Extract</li>
  <li>3/4 cups All-purpose flour</li>
  <li>2 tbsp Dry Milk</li>
  <li>1 tsp Salt</li>
</ul>
  

<h2>Instructions</h2>
<ol>
  <li>Preheat oven to 350°F (175°C)</li>
  <li>In a medium saucepan set over low-medium heat, melt the butter and chocolate together gently. While your chocolate and butter are slowly melting, mix together you cocoa powder, cinnamon, and espresso in a small bowl.</li>
  <li>Once your chocolate and butter are melted, turn off the heat and immediately whisk in the cocoa powder mixture.</li>
  <li>In a separate mixing bowl, utilize a hand mixer or a stand mixer equipped with the paddle attachment to beat the eggs, sugars, and vanilla extract together for about 4 minutes until light, fluffy, and slightly thickened. After this duration, if you were to rub the mixture between your fingers, there should be almost no detectable granules of sugar remaining.</li>
  <li>Slowly mix the melted chocolate mixture into the egg and sugar mixture, ensuring they are thoroughly combined.</li>
  <li>Add the flour, dry milk, and salt to the mixture and mix together just until there are no visible streaks of flour remaining. Avoid over-mixing to maintain a tender texture.</li>
  <li>This is also where you can throw in any ad-ins! (extra chocolate chips for example) </li>
  <li>Pour the brownie batter into a prepared 8 inch square pan, spreading it evenly. If you don't have a non-stick pan, i highly encourage you to line your pan with parchment paper to prevent sticking.</li>
  <li>Bake the brownies in the preheated oven for approximately 30 minutes, or until the edges are set and the center of the brownies slightly jiggles when gently shaken.</li>
  <li>Once baked, remove the pan from the oven and allow the brownies to cool completely in the pan. This cooling process will help them set properly and develop their fudgy texture.</li>
  <li>Once cooled, carefully lift the brownies out of the pan using the parchment paper as handles (or flip them over gently if you used a trustworthy non-stick pan) . Place them on a cutting board and slice into desired portions.</li>
  <li>Now, your perfectly baked fudge brownies are ready to be enjoyed! Serve them as is or with a dusting of powdered sugar, a scoop of ice cream, or any other desired toppings.</li>
